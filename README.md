# Create a documentation website
This repo contains the code needed to publish your great documentation. There are two deployment examples in this repo, with Netlify which allow you to add some backoffice if neededand with GitHub pages if a static site is enough for you. This documentation site template allows including its own content develped under `doc-contents` folder or external content from public, or private GitHub Repositories generated at build time, or content added at runtime, or any conbination of these.

`Related pages` and `Excerpt kewords` information is generated automatically at build time and the `sensitivity` of the generation process can be tuned from the settings, depending on the specifics of your content.

Apart from the taxonomies provided by default (tags and categories), each user can organise the documentation using its own defined taxonomies (custom tags, custom categories, document comments, documment annotations). Multiple ways of organising the docs can be used, **but only one can be active at a moment**. Users can also share the documentation organisation templates.
