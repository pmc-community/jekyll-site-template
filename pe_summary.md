in Normal Case, Justified, Double Line Spacing, and 
before spacing 14, after spacing 8, with double line

The abstract should 
consist of no more than 250 words. III. INTRODUCTION
The introduction should briefly describe the purpose 
of the work and how it relates to previous work.

It 
should also include a brief description of the methods 
used to carry out the work. VI. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The results and discussion sections should be combined 
into a single section.

Results should be presented in a way 
that allows the reader to understand the significance of 
the results without reference to the rest of the paper. The 
results should be described in sufficient detail to allow

CONCLUSION
The conclusion should summarize the main points of the article. VIII. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Acknowledgments should be placed in a separate section 
at the end of the manuscript.

descriptive word or phrase. For example, instead of labeling 
the x-axis with “cm,” label it with “distance (cm).”
B. Final Stage
When you submit your final version of the paper, please 
indicate whether you wish to have the paper printed in color 
or black and white.

. Figure captions should be placed below the figure. 2.

Each figure should have a caption that explains the 
figure’s content. The caption should be concise and 
self-explanatory. It should contain enough information 
to allow the reader to understand the figure without 
having to refer to the text.

3. Captions should be numbered consecutively throughout 
the paper. 4.

If there are more than one figure per page, each figure 
should be on a separate page. 5. All figures should be referred to in the text by their 
caption number, e.g., “Figure 1” or “Fig.

1.” Equations
Equations should be numbered consecutively in the order of 
their first appearance in the article, even if they occur within 
a single sentence. The equation number should be enclosed 
in parentheses and set flush with the right-hand margin. Use 
only one space between a number and the equal sign (+) or 
minus sign (−).

Do not put a period after an equation number 
unless it is followed by a new equation. E. References
List and number all references at the end of the article.

The 
reference list must be prepared in alphabetical order according 
to the surname of the first author of each reference. Papers 
published in translation journals should be given the English 
citation first, followed by their original foreign language 
citations. If there is more than one reference with the same 
author(s) and year of publication, list the authors followed by 
et al.

After the last reference in the list, Parenthetical 
citations include the author’s last name and the page 
number on which the information is presented. Narrative 
citation refers to the entire reference list at the end of 
your paper. If there are more than nine authors, list the first 
six followed by “et al.”; if there are fewer than nine 
authors, list all of them.

C. Abbreviations

practice in your field. If you must abbreviate a word, spell 
it out in full the first time you use it in the abstract and 
reference list.

D. Figures and Tables
Place figures and tables at the top and bottom of columns 
whenever possible. Avoid placing them in the middle of a 
column.

Provide a caption for each figure and table. Captions 
should be placed below the figure or above the table. Do 
not put footnotes or other explanatory matter in Do not use quotation marks 
around unit symbols: “K” for kelvin, “Hz” for cycles per 
second, “J” for joule, “m” for meter, “g” for gram, “mol” for 
mole, “s” for second, “C” for degree Celsius, “kcal” for kilo
- calorie, “M” for molarity, and so on.

This work is licensed under a Creative Commons 
Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 
International License. Do not hyphenate “i.e.” or “e.g.” if 
they appear at the end of a sentence. Do not put a period after 
an equation unless it is part of a title or heading.

When 
referring to yourself in the third person, use the form “he 
or she” rather than “his or her.” Avoid the passive voice as 
much as possible. In general, avoid the use of contractions 
such as “don’t” and “can’t.” If you wish to refer to a figure or table in your text, 
include a reference number in parentheses. The reference 
number should appear at the end of the sentence or paragraph 
in which it is cited.

If there is more than one figure or 
table with the same reference number, group them together 
with a comma between them. For example, if you want to write a sentence that says, 
“This is an example of what I’m trying to say,” you would 
write it like this: 

“I’m saying that this is one way to do it.” 

If you wanted to write something like, “This is another way 
to do it,” then you would write it as follows:  

“Another way to say this is…” 

You can also use these abbreviations when you’re quoting 
someone else’s words. For example, let’s say someone 
says, “I think this is a good idea.” You could write your 
own version of that quote by writing, “That’s what I think 
too.”  The editors reserve the right 
to reject papers that do not meet these criteria.
