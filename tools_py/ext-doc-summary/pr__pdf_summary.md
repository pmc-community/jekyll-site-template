The reporting period is October â€“ December (incl.) 2024, containing Quarter 8 of the implementation. The baseline for this report is the situation presented in the document Progress Report Q7. The project status presented in this report will be the new reporting baseline as of 1st of January 2020. This report will: summarise the activities carried out in the reporting period. It will also present the updated work breakdown structure, workplan and log frame. The main conclusions of this report are:The technical readiness was achieved in December 2024. Some tests cases received comments, all of them related to UX and user interface. All tests were passed with success; there is no failed test. All APIs were tested and there were no errors found. 

Comments about potential improvements related to the API documentation were well received. The deliverable was submitted to the Beneficiary and, currently, is pending approval. In October 2024 we produced the first version of the IMP.OR.D10 - Full plan for achieving Operational Readiness. A Steering Committee Meeting took place in Birnin Zana on 02 October 2024. The main objectives were to align the views of all stakeholders. The scope of the work was extended with activities that will allow us to assist the beneficiary for achieving the operational readiness. Sections 5, 6 and 7 will present the full encompass scope together with the overall planning and log frame. 

A Steering Committee Meeting took place in Birnin Zana on 02 October 2024. Stakeholders were informed about the results of the Site Acceptance Testing from July 2024. The project team was formed in compliance with ToR requirements, see ToR, section 6.1/7/28. The stakeholders were informed that an annex to the initial assignment was already signed by CAO and the Contactor. The annex extends the contract duration with 18 months. At the date of this report, the eID operator is still unknown. This being one of the major gaps/risks that needs to be filled in as soon as possible. 

The topic of eID API (to be used by third parties for integrating eID features in external systems) was raised by some stakeholders. Based on the expert opinion from a parallel AVENGERS-AID project, it was strongly demanded to make the API public as soon as possible. We explained that API is already available since Q4 2023 (after the functional testing session) in the PRE-PRODUCTION environment. However, our strong suggestion is to not release these APIs without putting in place dedicated technical and formal control mechanisms. 

The final Site Acceptance Testing session was carried out in Birnin Zana, on 6th and 7th of November 2024. The tests were carried out by a test team formally appointed by the beneficiary. For some test cases we collected suggestions for improvement which we will analyse and (if applicable) apply them on the eID system. The eID system is fully operable from the technical point of view, with all required features being present and working correctly. A dedicated API workshop and testing session was organised in Birnin Zana on 4th and 5th of December 2024. All details related to the final SAT results are presented in the deliverable Site Acceptance Test Report (SAT-FINAL) 

A well-defined formal and technical API control and monitoring framework must be put in place to provide, at any time, the information about who, why, how and when uses the API. The second important aspect clarified during the API session was related to the API release to market (issue raised mostly by the AVENGERS-AID project) eID features (authentication, signature, seal) are all supported by the APIs and allow the implementation of a wide range of use cases. In October 2024 we produced the first version of the IMP.OR.D10 - Full plan for achieving Operational Readiness which describes in detail what needs to be carried out by the main stakeholders. The eID system is hosted by the Agency for Informational Society (WISA) The main internal users are the Registration Officers who belongs to the Civil Registration Agency (WKCA). There is no single body to coordinate all these stakeholders. This is a serious risk that can have a negative impact when the actual certificates issuing services will start. The needed resources (human and material) necessary for providing the support services to the end-users (citizens and RAO) are not identified (sized) and provisioned. The necessary procedures and tools are not in place. For WKBR, issuing digital certificates (eSeal) is a new task.

Monitoring is a constant ongoing activity started in the first day of the implementation. The main output of this activity is this report which covers Quarter 8 (MCPR-8). This activity is in progress and will be completed at the end of the Implementation (est. July 2026). 

Mostly the human resources involved must understand that eID will be part of their day-by-day duties when speaking about providing certificate issuing services. At the date of this report, the eID operator is still not formally appointed, thus we consider that the issue which was raised by us even from June 2023 turned into a risk having a negative impact on the achievement of the operational readiness. 

The progress on the log frame is shown in the table below. The project objective is to increase efficiency and productivity of the private sector through increased use of ICT. At the date of this report, the progress has been made on Objective 1 and Objective 2. Technical Support Level 2 and Level 3 is not started yet.

At least 10 training sessions for 2 days/ each were organised. All potential non-conformities (from FunctionalTesting testing) were corrected. The product documentation is complete and delivered to the relevant stakeholders. The system is installed and configured in the production environment. The planning of the training sessions is completed and approved before the deployment to production.

C&V strategy delivered before the start of the testing phase. The usage of eID in the private sector through ICT remains high. Distribution channels (YouTube, Social Media, IMP.AR.D9-2) established before the approval. Video materials produced, discussed and implemented.

Deliverable IMP.OR.D10 contains: Description of all activities necessary to be implemented. Efficient institutional capacities for achieving operational readiness. Clear indication of the role and responsibility of eID platform by WKCA and WKBR.

The next reporting period is Q9 (January, February, March 2025) Next steps will include the period necessary for drafting the next Progress Report (MCPR-9) The next PSC meeting will be held on 27/28/28 November 2018. For confidential support call the Samaritans on 08457 90 90 90, visit a local Samaritans branch or see www.samaritans.org. At the end of the next reporting period, the expected new deliverables will be:.Design of the Support Organisation (IMP.TS.D11-1) Full design of the Tools for Technical Support (as part of IMP. TS. D11-2) Quarterly Technical Support Report as dedicated section in the Progress report for Q9 MC.PR-9 Implementation of the tools needed by the eID operator to provide technical support to the citizens and RAO.
