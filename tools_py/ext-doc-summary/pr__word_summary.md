This Progress Report was drafted in accordance with the provisions of the ToR (§7.1-Reporting Requirements) and with the Revised Organisation and Methodology. The reporting period is October – December (incl.) 2024, containing Quarter 8 of the implementation. The project status presented in this report will be the new reporting baseline as of January 2025.

The project status presented in this report will be the new reporting baseline as of 1st of January 2025.

The reporting period for this Progress Report is 01 October 2024 – 31 December 2024. The new end date of the contract is 16 July 2026. Sections 5, 6 and 7 will present the full scope together with the overall planning and log frame.

A visual representation of the overall progress of the initial scope of the work is presented in the figure below.

Team mobilisation was performed after the contract signature with the goal of appointing the experts on the roles from the team organisation. For the other roles, we created a pool of experts to be presented to the Beneficiary and introduced into the implementation as the activities will advance. The stakeholders were informed about the results of the Site Acceptance Testing from July 2024.

The Beneficiary was informed about the risks of switching later to an official Google developer account belonging to a public administration entity from Wakanda, the risks were taken, and we proceeded accordingly. The other comments and findings from the first SAT session (all of them being no blocking issues, cosmetic issues, UX issues) were incorporated in the final version of the eID system. The topic of eID API (to be used by third parties for integrating eID features in external systems) was raised by some stakeholders.

Based on the expert opinion from a parallel AVENGERS-AID project, it was strongly demanded to make the API public as soon as possible. We explained that API is already available since Q4 2023 (after the functional testing session) in the PRE-PRODUCTION environment. Final Site Acceptance Testing session was carried out in Birnin Zana, on 6th and 7th of November 2024.

The tests were carried out by a test team formally appointed by the beneficiary. All tests were passed with success; there is no failed test. Some tests cases received comments, all of them related to UX and user interface.

A dedicated API workshop and testing session was organised in Birnin Zana on 4th and 5th of December 2024. The conclusion is that the eID system provides all needed API for integrating eID features into third party systems. Wakanda received a fully featured electronic wallet together with the possibility to use it for the use cases related to eID.

A well-defined formal and technical API control and monitoring framework must be put in place to provide, at any time, the information about who, why, how and when uses the APIs. The workshop was attended by the representatives of the development teams of eWakanda and eNotary systems. It was useful to identify the most probable integration use cases.

The Full plan for achieving Operational Readiness (IMP.OR.D10) identifies the gaps between the situation at the end of the technical implementation (technical readiness) and the TO-BE situation now when the operational readiness will be achieved. The eID system is hosted by the Agency for Informational Society (WISA) which activates under the Ministry of Interior (WMI). The main internal users are the Registration Officers who belongs to the Civil Registration Agency (WKCA) for issuing the digital certificates for citizens.

Full plan for achieving Operational Readiness (IMP.OR.D10 ) describes the activities that needs to be carried out for filling-in the gaps. It sets a timetable for gradually achieving operational readiness (in 3 levels: minimal, fair and full) by the end of 2025. The following table illustrates the timetable of activities and the roles and responsibilities.

Even from the Steering Committee Meeting held in Birnin Zana we raised the issue of eID “ownership” which means the formal appointment of the eID operator. We will define these resources within some of the activities that will be executed in the first part of 2025, as illustrated in Table 1
- Plan for achieving Operational Readiness in 2025.

During the reporting period the scope of the work was extended. This generated modifications of the Work Breakdown Structure in the sense of adding phases/implementation chapters/deliverables. The new WBS is presented in this section.

For easier understanding of the codes used for the elements, we include below the coding convention.

For the different log frame components (objectives, outputs activities), we use the following colour convention to mark the vertical bars for identifying the mentioned components. For the updated status of indicators/means of verification on the Log Frame we used the following colours to highlight the progress. At the date of this report, the progress on the log frame is shown in the table below.

The contract was extended until July 2026. L2 and L3 support will be provided to the Beneficiary by the end of the contract. Operational readiness will be achieved in 2025.

The outputs/deliverables of the new activities were included in the project WBS. The log frame was also modified accordingly.

The next reporting period is Q9 (January, February, March 2025) The expected new deliverables will be:
- Design of the Support Organisation (IMP.TS.D11-1)
- Full design of the Tools for Technical Support (as part of IMP. TS. D11-2)
- Implementation of the tools needed by the eID operator to provide technical support to the end-users (citizens and RAO)
