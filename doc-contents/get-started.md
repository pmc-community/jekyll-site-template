# Organise
Getting started with Docaroo requires, first of all, to `design your documentation`. Organising well your documentation (or blog) is crucial. This will involve defining the folder structure and also the taxonomies. That's all you need since, Docaroo can take care of automatically generating other information about you documentation.

{% include elements/link-btn.html type="primary" outline="false" text="Organise docs" href="/content/intro/#id_organise_documents" newTab="true" %}

# Install
After you designed your documentaion, you need to install the local environment. You will need at least to:
- install Ruby
- install Jekyll
- [fork or clone or download](https://github.com/pmc-community/jekyll-site-template/tree/gh-pages) and unzip the site framework. Rename it as you wish. 
- (optional) install Python 3.9 to use the Python based features (keywords and summary generation, related and similar pages detection)

# Customise
Use configuration files for customising your site as you need. 

# Create
Next, you need to transpose the documentation into `doc-contents` folder in your project folder. Create your content there as `markdown files` in free form and/or using the ready-made Docaroo components and re-usable content.

# Test
Deploy locally using one simple command launched from your project directory. Open a terminal window, navigate inside your project directory and type `./serve`
