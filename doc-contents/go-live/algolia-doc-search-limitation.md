Be aware of the Algolia DocSearch limitations. One of the eligibility criteria for free usage of Algolia DocSearch is to be used on public documentation/technical blogging sites. If you plan an internal organisational site, you may be not eligible for Algolia DocSearch and you may need to extend the site searching UI experience with Algolia Search or to use the default search feature which is not so advanced as any Algolia search option.
