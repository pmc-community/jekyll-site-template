# Summary
Learn how to add different pre-defined `components` and `content-items` to your content. These are elements that can be embedded in your documents using `liquid` tags and `parameters` as it will be shown for each of the next components.

Pre-defined components represents the most efficient way to create complex and easy to maintain quality content in your docs. We focused on complex components, without having any intention to overwrite the default functionalities of markdown syntax for simple pieces of content as formatting text, headings, simple inline links and other similar.

Pre-defined content items are pieces of content that can be used directly in your documents or are used inside the pre-defined components.
