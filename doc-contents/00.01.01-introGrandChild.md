# Summary
Learn how to use Docaroo components to embed rich media into your content. We do not encourage to store large media on your doc-contents folder. Since this is a documentation site, the access to the media files should be public since we don't have a backend to make the requests to get the media, thus any private access key cannot be exposed. 

# Figma files
Currently we support design, boards (fig jam) and slides files. Prototypes are not supported for the moment, we are working on this.

{% include elements/alert.html class="primary" content="Note that Figma file ids are different for design, boards, slide and decks, thus you can make public (and embed) only what you really want to share form your Figma project. In the next examples, the whole Figma project is public for view only." title="Figma files" %}

{% include elements/alert.html class="warning" content="Page navigator is allowed only for slide files. For design and board files the page navigator is disabled." title="Page navigation" %}

You have to be aware that your visitors can open the embedded file in Figma. `View only` permission will allow the visitors to post comments which can be viewed and replied to by any other visitor.

{% include elements/alert.html class="primary" content="Comments are not visible on the embedded file on page, can be seen only when open the file in Figma." title="Comments on embedded file" %}

{% include elements/alert.html class="danger" content="Be very careful to what permissions you grant to the visitors when embedding Figma files. Normally, you should not allow more than `View only` permission." title="Permissions" %}

## Design
Embed Figma design, starting from a specific node, with a thin border around it.

{% highlight javascript %}
{% raw %}{% include elements/figma.html what="design" file="vJEs0lhqI4OnqzaZBKeR4k" node="10-2&t=W2N493rkaJxxmBy0-4" %}{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% include elements/figma.html what="design" file="vJEs0lhqI4OnqzaZBKeR4k" node="10-2&t=W2N493rkaJxxmBy0-4" %}

## Fig jam
Embed Figma board, starting from the root node, with a thin border around it.

{% highlight javascript %}
{% raw %}{% include elements/figma.html what="board" file="jNZumE2gKxP4PE8fZBBxJt" node="0-1" border="true" %}{% endraw %}

## Slides
{% include elements/alert.html class="warning" content="Be aware that slides may not work well on mobile, is a known issue. For this reason we recommend to embed deck files" title="Slide files on mobile" %}

{% highlight javascript %}
{% raw %}{% include elements/figma.html what="deck" file="D4jLYCi1QWiKbPXuHrOOd8" border="false" h="400px" resetBtn="false" %}{% endraw %}
