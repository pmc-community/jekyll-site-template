# Summary
This component helps enhancing your content with auto generated summaries from PDF files. It is combined with the download component, so the output rendered will be a summary of the PDF file and a download button to download the original file. The summary of a given pdf file and will be saved in the same folder as the source PDF. As much as possible, the component generates also a simple ToC of the summary to enable easy navigation for larges summaries.

We cannot guarantee 100% the quality of the summary generated by this component as this depends on various parameters (such as: the model used, the language, the correct spelling and grammar, the structure of inputs). For this reason we advice to review and do corrections as needed before deploying the result to your production site. After applying manual corrections is necessary to build and deploy the site again. The summary will not be generated one more time, the previously corrected text will be used to render the content.

{% include elements/alert.html class="primary" content="We use local downloaded models from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/models){: target=\"_blank\"}. Your data will be not sent to Huggingface to be used for training the models. This implies that updating the models to the last version is not automatically and, when needed, should be made manually by removing the specific `cached model` from `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/*` on MacOS/Linux or from `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.cache\huggingface\hub` on Windows." %}

# Example
The next example is based on the following files:

{% DirStructure doc-contents/_experiments/pdf-summary %}

The model used for this summarisation is:

```yml
{% 
    ExternalRepoContent  { 
        "markdown": true,
        "owner":"pmc-community", 
        "repo":"jekyll-site-template", 
        "branch":"gh-pages", 
        "file_path":"_data/buildConfig.yml", 
        "ignore_wp_shortcodes": true, 
        "start_marker": "pdf_sum_model",
        "include_start_marker": true,
        "end_marker": "facebook/bart-large-cnn\"" ,
        "include_end_marker": true,
        "needAuth": true
    }
%}
```

In the next example we have the generated summary, without any manual correction to allow understanding the limitations of the used model (which is one of the best rated open source and multilanguage summarisation model for medium and large texts). However, the model can be replaced easily in `_data/buildConfig.yml` configuration file. In case of a multilanguage documentation site, it is even possible to set a different model for each language. Be aware that not all open source models can work in this summarisation context. If a non compatible model is set, the raised error message (at build time) will give a list of compatible models to be chosen from `Huggingface`.

Note that the PDF summaries are saved in the same folder as the original pdf file and are named `<pdf_file_name>__pdf_summary.txt`. When building the site, as long as a file respecting the naming convention is found in the folder, the summary for `<pdf_file_name>.pdf` will be not generated again. Feel free to apply any manual correction to the summary file for removing not relevant paragraphs and/or model hallucinations. Be aware that, after each manual correction, the site must be built again. If is needed to force re-generating the summary, just delete the `<pdf_file_name>__pdf_summary.txt` and build the site again.

{% include elements/alert.html class="warning" content="Keep in mind that re-generation of the summary will lose any previously applied manual corrections." %}

{% raw %}
```javascript
{% include elements/pdf-summary.html 
    file="_experiments/pdf-summary/pr.pdf"
    btnType="danger"
    btnOutline="false"
    btnText="Download PDF"
    sBorder="true"
    sh="300px"
%}
```
{% endraw %}

`START PDF SUMMARY`

{% include elements/pdf-summary.html 
    file="_experiments/pdf-summary/pr.pdf"
    btnType="danger"
    btnOutline="false"
    btnText="Download PDF"
    sBorder="true"
    sh="300px"
%}

`END PDF SUMMARY`

The quality of the summary depends very much on the way in which the original document is structured and written. The next example demonstrates a new generated summary, without any addtional correction, but applied on a document having a different structure and generating a better quality text.

`START PDF SUMMARY`

{% include elements/pdf-summary.html 
    file="_experiments/pdf-summary/pt.pdf"
    btnType="danger"
    btnOutline="false"
    btnText="Download PDF"
    sBorder="true"
    sh="300px"
%}

`END PDF SUMMARY`

{% include elements/alert.html class="primary" content="There is no general rule to establish if a certain PDF will generate a better quality summary. The best way to use this experiment is to start with the auto-generated summary, review it with care and apply manual corrections where needed." %}

# Corrections
As described, corrections can be manually applied to the generated summaries for removing not relevant paragraphs or model hallucinations. The summarisation algorithm is set to generate rather detailed summaries to allow choosing the relevant parts for rendering to the document. However, pdf summarisation is usually less structured than docx ones because structure extraction from a pdf is looser than in docx where it can be hooked to the headings from the docx. On the other hand, pdf summaries may contain more relevant details.

{% include elements/alert.html class="primary" content="When working with docx, it is a good practice to compare the summary generated for the original docx with the summary generated for the same document converted to pdf and choose the one that suits better your purpose." %}

# Limitations
Tables, images and sections like Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Figures are usually excluded from summarisation. To the best extent possible, annotation, comments, references, bibliography, citations and similar sections are also excluded.  

{% include elements/alert.html class="warning" content="The models may not always detect this kind of sections in an accurate way, this being another reason for which we strongly recommend checking the generated summaries and apply manual corrections as needed. Let's say that summarisation makes 90% of the job, but the remaining 10% can make the difference." %}

# Parameters
- `file`: path to the PDF file provided as relative path from the root of doc-contents folder
- `btnType`: type of the download button, default value is `primary`.  See **[`Downloads`](/components/download-link/){: target="_blank"}**.
- `btnOutline`: type of the outline of the download button, default value is `false`.  See **[`Downloads`](/components/download-link/){: target="_blank"}**.
- `btnText`: text on the download button, default value is `Download`.  See **[`Downloads`](/components/download-link/){: target="_blank"}**. Note that there is not automatic translation of this label. Since it can be set as parameter, is needed to be manually adapted to the site language.
- `sBorder`: the PDF summary block has or not a thin border, default value is `false`
- `sh`: the PDF summary block has or not a fixed height, default value is `auto`.

{% include elements/alert.html class="primary" content="Since summaries can be pretty long sometimes, we recommend to set a fixed height to increase the readibility of the document and the UX when reading." title="Tip" %}
