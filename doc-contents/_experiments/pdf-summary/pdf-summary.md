# Summary
This component helps enhancing your content with auto generated summaries of PDF files. It is cmbined with the download component, so the output rendered will be a summary of the PDF file and a download button to donload the original file. The summary of a given pdf file and will be saved in the same folder as the source PDF. 

We cannot guarantee 100% the quality of the summary generated by this component as this depends on various parameters (such as: the model used, the language, the correct spelling and grammar, the structure of inputs). For this reason we advice to review and do corrections as needed before publishing (deploying) the result on your production site. After applying potential manual corrections it is necessary to build the site again. The summary will not be generated one more time, the previously corrected text will be used to render the content. 

# Example
The next example is based on the following folder:

{% DirStructure doc-contents/_experiments/pdf-summary %}

The model used for this summarisation is:

```yml
{% 
    ExternalRepoContent  { 
        "markdown": true,
        "owner":"pmc-community", 
        "repo":"jekyll-site-template", 
        "branch":"gh-pages", 
        "file_path":"_data/buildConfig.yml", 
        "ignore_wp_shortcodes": true, 
        "start_marker": "pdf_sum_model",
        "include_start_marker": true,
        "end_marker": "facebook/bart-large-cnn\"" ,
        "include_end_marker": true,
        "needAuth": true
    }
%}
```

Note that the summaries are saved in the same folder as the original pdf file and are named `<pdf_file_name>__pdf_summary.txt`. When building the site, as long as a file respecting the naming convention is found in the folder, the summary for `<pdf_file_name>.pdf` will be not generated again. Feel free to apply any manual correction to the summary file for removing potential not relevant paragraphs and/or model hallucinations. Be aware that, after each manual correction, the site must be built again. If is needed to force re-generating the summary, just delete the `<pdf_file_name>__pdf_summary.txt` and build the site again. Keep in mind that re-generation of the summary will lose any previously applied manual corrections.
