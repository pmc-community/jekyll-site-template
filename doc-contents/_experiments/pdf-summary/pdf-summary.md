# Summary
This component helps enhancing your content with auto generated summaries of PDF files. It is combined with the download component, so the output rendered will be a summary of the PDF file and a download button to donload the original file. The summary of a given pdf file and will be saved in the same folder as the source PDF. 

We cannot guarantee 100% the quality of the summary generated by this component as this depends on various parameters (such as: the model used, the language, the correct spelling and grammar, the structure of inputs). For this reason we advice to review and do corrections as needed before deploying the result to your production site. After applying manual corrections is necessary to build and deploy the site again. The summary will not be generated one more time, the previously corrected text will be used to render the content. 

# Example
The next example is based on the following files:

{% DirStructure doc-contents/_experiments/pdf-summary %}

The model used for this summarisation is:

```yml
{% 
    ExternalRepoContent  { 
        "markdown": true,
        "owner":"pmc-community", 
        "repo":"jekyll-site-template", 
        "branch":"gh-pages", 
        "file_path":"_data/buildConfig.yml", 
        "ignore_wp_shortcodes": true, 
        "start_marker": "pdf_sum_model",
        "include_start_marker": true,
        "end_marker": "facebook/bart-large-cnn\"" ,
        "include_end_marker": true,
        "needAuth": true
    }
%}
```

Note that the PDF summaries are saved in the same folder as the original pdf file and are named `<pdf_file_name>__pdf_summary.txt`. When building the site, as long as a file respecting the naming convention is found in the folder, the summary for `<pdf_file_name>.pdf` will be not generated again. Feel free to apply any manual correction to the summary file for removing not relevant paragraphs and/or model hallucinations. Be aware that, after each manual correction, the site must be built again. If is needed to force re-generating the summary, just delete the `<pdf_file_name>__pdf_summary.txt` and build the site again. Keep in mind that re-generation of the summary will lose any previously applied manual corrections.

`START PDF SUMMARY`

{% capture c %}
{% ExtPDFSummary _experiments/pdf-summary/pr.pdf %}
{% endcapture %}
{{c}}

{% include elements/downloads.html 
    type="warning" 
    outline="false" 
    text="Download" 
    file="pr.pdf"
    downloadName="pr.pdf"    
%}

`END PDF SUMMARY`

# Corrections
As described, corrections can be manually applied to the generated summaries for removing not relevant paragraphs or model hallucinations. The summarisation algorithm is set to generate rather detailed summaries to allow choosing the relevant parts for rendering to the document. However, pdf summarisation is usually less structured than docx ones because structure extraction from a pdf is looser than in docx where it can be hooked to the headings from the docx. On the other hand, pdf summaries may contain more relevant details. For this reason, when working with docx, it is a good practice to compare the summary generated for the original docx with the summary generated for the same document converted to pdf and choose the one that suits better your purpose.

# Limitations
Tables, images and sections like Table of Contents, List of Tables, List of Figures are usually excluded from summmarisation. To the best extent possible, annotation, comments, references, bibliography, citations and similar sections are also excluded. However, the models may not always detect thses kind of sections in an accurate way, this being another reason for which we strongly recommend checking the ghenerated summaries and apply manual corrections as needed. Let's say that summarisation makes 905 of the job, but the remaining 10% may make the difference.
