Adding, removing and updating custom categories works exactly in the same way as the similar features related to the custom tags. The only feature that is not available for custom categories is adding custom categories to documents from selected text in the document body.

{% include elements/alert.html 
  class="primary" 
  content="Site categories cannot be modified or removed. Also, it is not possible to duplicate a site category with a custom category."
  title="Note" 
%}

{% include elements/link-btn.html 
    type="warning" 
    text="Custom tags" 
    href="/taxonomies/custom-tags/" 
%}
