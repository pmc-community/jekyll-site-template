# Summary
One of the most powerful features we offer out-of-the-box is defining and using custom taxonomies. This feature allows the users to organise the information in a way that suits their preference, making the usage of documentation to be customised as per the goal and purpose needed by the user. There is no limit in how many ways the documentation can be organised using custom taxonomies, meaning that the users can have one taxonomy system for each purpose. For example, if the purpose is to define a way to understand some workflows, this can be realised with one taxonomy system. In the same time, if for the same documentation, it is necessary to group the documents for understanding concepts, this can be another taxonomy system. The only limitation is that, at one moment, only one taxonomy system can be active. The taxonomy systems can be saved and loaded at any time and users can even share them.

Taxonomy systems are composed from tags, categories, document notes and in-document annotations. Be aware that custom tags and categories cannot duplicate the ones coming defined at build time.
