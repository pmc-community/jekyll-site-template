Docaroo comes by default with the possibility to assign categories and tags to your documents (site taxonomies). Additionally, custom taxonomies feature is available. As such, the users can define and use their own custom tags and categories. Notes to documents and annotations (comments) features are available. Cutom taxonomies can be saved as local files then can be loaded as needed or shared with teammates.
