Docaroo offers the possibility to style it and extend it as you need. The configuration files allows different levels of configuration which requires low programming skills or no coding at all. The hooks system allows extension of the functionalities on licent side. Apart from these, Docaroo is open source, you can customise it as you want by modifiyng its code, without any restriction. However, we would appreciate the ususl Github flow, forking, customising and create pull requests, so the whole community could benefit.
