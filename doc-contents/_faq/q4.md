q: What is Docaroo stack?
---

Docaroo is, in essence, a Jekyll site optimised for deployment with Github pages, although any other deployment is possible. So, the core of Docaroo is based mostly on Ruby and Javascript. However, some of the features (such as automatic keywords and summary generation, detecting related and similar pages) are based on Python.
