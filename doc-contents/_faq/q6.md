q: Is Docaroo multilanguage?
---

Yes, Docaroo supports multilanguage. However, automatic deployment of a Docaroo multilanguage site is fully supported only with Github pages. For other deployments you need to handle it depending on your production environment. We also support automatic deployment with Netlify, but only for single-language Docaroo instances.
