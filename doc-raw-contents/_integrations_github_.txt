docaroo offers out-of-the-box the possibility to integrate with github and to import content from public and private repositories. while there is no limit when it comes to how many public repositories can be accessed, for the private repositories, content can be imported only from the repositories within the scope of the personal access token that must be configured. content from external public github repositories can be also imported at run time. for the moment, we do not support importing content from private github repositories at run time, this being possible only at build time. build time run time using the github integration depends on the deployment type. when testing on local dev environment or when the deployment is on a custom infrastructure, the settings from file are used as shown next. when the deployment is on or , then the github integration parameters should be configured in as in github or in netlify. the names of the integration parameters is the same, regardless of the deployment environment (local, custom, github pages or netlify). you may need to consult the github documentation or the netlify documentation to find out how to create your personal access token and how to define action secrets (github) or environment variables (netlify). netlify check here the deployment of this site on .
