there is no failed test. some tests cases received comments, all of them related to ux and user interface. a dedicated api workshop and testing session was organised in birnin zana on 4th and 5th of december 2024. the conclusion is that the eid system provides all needed api for integrating eid features into third party systems. wakanda received a fully featured electronic wallet together with the possibility to use it for the use cases related to eid. a well-defined formal and technical api control and monitoring framework must be put in place to provide, at any time, the information about who, why, how and when uses the apis. the workshop was attended by the representatives of the development teams of ewakanda and enotary systems. it was useful to identify the most probable integration use cases. the full plan for achieving operational readiness (imp.or.d10) identifies the gaps between the situation at the end of the technical implementation (technical readiness) and the to-be situation now when the operational readiness will be achieved. the eid system is hosted by the agency for informational society (wisa) which activates under the ministry of interior (wmi). the main internal users are the registration officers who belongs to the civil registration agency (wkca) for issuing the digital certificates for citizens. full plan for achieving operational readiness (imp.or.d10 ) describes the activities that needs to be carried out for filling-in the gaps. it sets a timetable for gradually achieving operational readiness (in 3 levels: minimal, fair and full) by the end of 2025. the following table illustrates the timetable of activities and the roles and responsibilities. risks and assumptions even from the steering committee meeting held in birnin zana we raised the issue of eid “ownership” which means the formal appointment of the eid operator. we will define these resources within some of the activities that will be executed in the first part of 2025, as illustrated in table 1 - plan for achieving operational readiness in 2025. work breakdown structure during the reporting period the scope of the work was extended. this generated modifications of the work breakdown structure in the sense of adding phases/implementation chapters/deliverables. the new wbs is presented in this section. for easier understanding of the codes used for the elements, we include below the coding convention. log frame for the different log frame components (objectives, outputs activities), we use the following colour convention to mark the vertical bars for identifying the mentioned components. for the updated status of indicators/means of verification on the log frame we used the following colours to highlight the progress. at the date of this report, the progress on the log frame is shown in the table below. workplan the contract was extended until july 2026. l2 and l3 support will be provided to the beneficiary by the end of the contract. operational readiness will be achieved in 2025. the outputs/deliverables of the new activities were included in the project wbs. the log frame was also modified accordingly. next steps the next reporting period is q9 (january, february, march 2025) the expected new deliverables will be: - design of the support organisation (imp.ts.d11-1) - full design of the tools for technical support (as part of imp. ts. d11-2) - implementation of the tools needed by the eid operator to provide technical support to the end-users (citizens and rao). download
