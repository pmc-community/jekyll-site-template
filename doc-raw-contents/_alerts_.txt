learn how to add alert blocks to your content. you can add both simple and rich alerts. alerts can be of different types as shown by the colors (primary, success, warning, danger and info). alerts can contain content introduced in clear but also can refer external content from other documents from your documentation or from external public or private repositories. the external content can either added using liquid sintax or custom liquid tags. limitations:. there is no limit about how many external public repositories you refer the number of the external private repositories depends on the private access key type you configure. however, the current limitation is that you cannot access private repositories from more than one github account or organisation (depending on the permissions of your private key). if you set a key to access a single private repo, then that repo is the only one that you can refer. currently we support only github repositories. add a simple primary alert to your page like this: {% include elements/alert.html class="primary" content="primary alert" title="title" %}. title primary alert. add content taken from external files to your alerts like this. content is taken from another file that can be in the same repo or in other pubic (or private) repo. {% capture c %}. {% externalsitecontent. {. "markdown": true,. "file_path":"_collection-2/z/z.md",. "ignore_wp_shortcodes": true,. "start_marker": "",. "include_start_marker": false,. "end_marker": "",. "include_end_marker": false,. "needauth": true. }. %}{% endcapture %}{% include elements/alert.html class="success" content=c %}. external content this file loads some external content from another repo and place it inline. link to file in different folder. add simple alerts to your page like this: {% include elements/alert.html class="danger" content="danger alert" title="title" %}{% include elements/alert.html class="warning" content="warning alert" title="title" %}{% include elements/alert.html class="info" content="info alert" title="title" %}. title danger alert. title warning alert. title info alert. add selected content from another file from your doc-contents folder using the following code. first, it captures the content of the external file into file_content_result. second, it captures only the first occurrence of the text between the given markers into substr_result. when using start and end markers, be sure that these exists in the source file. the markers are not included in the returned text. empty markers are not accepted. {% capture included_content %}. {% include_relative 00-intro.md %}{% endcapture %}{% include siteincludes/modules/utilities.liquid filecontent=included_content %}{% include siteincludes/modules/utilities.liquid basestring=file_content_result markerstart="(ro)" markerend="it has" %}{% include elements/alert.html class="warning" content=substr_result title="title" %}. title contrary to popular belief, lorem ipsum is not simply random text. add selected content from another file from your doc-contents folder using the following code. add also rich media to your alert content. it captures the content of the external file into file_content_result. the captured content must be between the standard exposed section markers defined in site.data.siteconfig.extcontentmarkers.startexposedsection ( and ). if the external file does not have these markers, the captured content will be empty string. the next example shows how to add rich media content (in this case we added a lottie animation) to the alert title (the same is applicable to alert body) {% capture included_content %}. {% include_relative partials/part1.md %}{% endcapture %}{% include siteincludes/modules/utilities.liquid filecontent=included_content %}. {% capture animation %}. {% include elements/lottie.html id="b9c3d8e8-0304-49ea-8c47-1fb872d8cae3/uun7mtirmp" h=15 w=15 pad=0 %}{% endcapture %}. {% assign title = animation | append: "animation title" %}. {% include elements/alert.html class="danger" content=file_content_result title=title %}. animation title partial 1 h2 from partial md file i am a paragraph from a partial file under a h2 title. the h2 title will be placed in toc under the first h1 found in the document above this h2 title. h1 from partial file i am a paragraph from a partial file under a h1 title. the h1 title will be placed on the 1st level of toc.
