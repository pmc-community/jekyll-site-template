sharing custom taxonomies is a feature that allows the users to save and load a certain custom taxonomy configuration. this means that custom taxonomies can be used by may users or, maybe even more important, a user can configure multiple custom taxonomies and load them to fit the purpose of using the site. for example, custom taxonomies can define specific workflows of interests (such as installation and configuration documents) or can define processes (such as development, testing). the only limitation is that only one custom taxonomy configuration can be active at a certain moment. note a custom taxonomy configuration stays active as long it is not overwritten by another one.
