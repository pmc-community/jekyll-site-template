learn how to use docaroo components to embed rich media into your content. we do not encourage to store large media on your doc-contents folder. since this is a documentation site, the access to the media files should be public since we don’t have a backend to make the requests to get the media, thus any private access key cannot be exposed. currently we support design, boards (fig jam) and slides files. prototypes are not supported for the moment, we are working on this. figma files note that figma file ids are different for design, boards, slide and decks, thus you can make public (and embed) only what you really want to share form your figma project. in the next examples, the whole figma project is public for view only. page navigation page navigator is allowed only for slide files. for design and board files the page navigator is disabled. you have to be aware that your visitors can open the embedded file in figma. view only permission will allow the visitors to post comments which can be viewed and replied to by any other visitor. comments on embedded file comments are not visible on the embedded file on page, can be seen only when open the file in figma. permissions be very careful to what permissions you grant to the visitors when embedding figma files. normally, you should not allow more than view only permission. embed figma design, starting from a specific node, with a thin border around it. {% include elements/figma.html what="design" file="vjes0lhqi4onqzazbker4k" node="10-2&t=w2n493rkajxxmby0-4" %}. loading. reset view. embed figma board, starting from the root node, with a thin border around it. {% include elements/figma.html what="board" file="jnzume2gkxp4pe8fzbbxjt" node="0-1" border="true" %}. loading. reset view. slide files on mobile be aware that slides may not work well on mobile, is a known issue. for this reason we recommend to embed deck files. {% include elements/figma.html what="slides" file="d4jlyci1qwikbpxuhrood8" border="true" %}. loading. reset view. reset view button deck files doesn’t need a reset view button since slide navigation is added by default. also, there is no way to lose the slides from focus as in case of design and boards with pan move. {% include elements/figma.html what="deck" file="d4jlyci1qwikbpxuhrood8" border="false" h="400px" resetbtn="false" %}. loading. {% include elements/youtube.html id="hfspgkqmuzc" width="640" height="360" %}. {% include elements/vimeo.html id="1089723439" width="640" height="360" %}. {% include elements/lottie.html id="b9c3d8e8-0304-49ea-8c47-1fb872d8cae3/uun7mtirmp" h=50 w=50 pad=0 %}
