learn how to use docaroo components to embed rich media into your content. we do not encourage to store large media on your doc-contents folder. since this is a documentation site, the access to the media files should be public since we donâ€™t have a backend to make the requests to get the media, thus any private access key cannot be exposed. currently we support design, boards (fig jam) and slides files. prototypes are not supported for the moment, we are working on this. figma files note that figma file ids are different for design, boards, slide and decks, thus you can make public (and embed) only what you really want to share form your figma project. in the next examples, the whole project is public for view only. page navigation page navigator is allowed only for slide files. for design and board files the page navigator is disabled. embed figma design, starting from a specific node, with a thin border around it. {% include elements/figma.html what="design" file="vjes0lhqi4onqzazbker4k" node="10-2&t=w2n493rkajxxmby0-4" border=true %}. loading. reset view. embed figma board, starting from the root node, with a thin border around it. {% include elements/figma.html what="board" file="jnzume2gkxp4pe8fzbbxjt" node="0-1" border=true %}. loading. reset view. loading. reset view. {% include elements/youtube.html id="hfspgkqmuzc" width="640" height="360" %}. {% include elements/vimeo.html id="1089723439" width="640" height="360" %}. {% include elements/lottie.html id="b9c3d8e8-0304-49ea-8c47-1fb872d8cae3/uun7mtirmp" h=50 w=50 pad=0 %}
